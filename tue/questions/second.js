// Given four digits, count how many valid times can be displayed on a digital clock (in 24-hour format) using those digits. The earliest time is 00:00 and the latest time is 23:59.

// Write a function:

// int solution(int A, int B, int C, int D);

// that, given four integers A, B, C and D (describing the four digits), returns the number of valid times that can be displayed on a digital clock.

// Examples:

// 1. Given A = 1, B = 8, C = 3, D = 2, the function should return 6. The valid times are: 12:38, 13:28, 18:23, 18:32, 21:38 and 23:18.

// 2. Given A = 2, B = 3, C = 3, D = 2, the function should return 3. The valid times are: 22:33, 23:23 and 23:32.

// 3. Given A = 6, B = 2, C = 4, D = 7, the function should return 0. It is not possible to display any valid time using the given digits.

// Assume that:

// A, B, C and D are integers within the range [0..9].
// In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
